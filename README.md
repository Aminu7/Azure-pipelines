This was created during my exploration of Azure pipelines
The legendary book used was Chaminda Chandrasekara, Pushpa Herath - Hands-on Azure Pipelines_ Understanding Continuous Integration and Deployment in Azure DevOps (2020, Apress)
I jumped to Chapter 8: Creating and Using YAML Build Pipelines because thats whats most needed for now
I hope I get a chance to read the entire book
